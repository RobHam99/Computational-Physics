# Verlet_Project

- Individual task files contain functions that return accelerations to the Verlet integrators.  
- Algorithms file contains all variations of the Verlet integrator created.  
- Data files have not been uploaded with anything in them because they are large so it is a waste of time.  
- Task_7i.py is without stochastic initialisation, Task_7iii.py is with.
