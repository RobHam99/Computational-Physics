## Parallel Python

I am learning to use the multiprocessing package in Python. Most files here are random tests, but I created a Mandelbrot program to view the difference in speeds when using multiple processes at once, I am using a 6 core Macbook Pro and the maximum iterations for the Mandelbrot function is 1000. Here is a plot comparing the efficiency of using multiple processes. It is easy to see that time improves until 6 cores when it starts to slow again because there are only 6 cores in my laptop.
